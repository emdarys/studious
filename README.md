This program is a linear equation solver.
It is run by simply typing "python3 eqn.py" in the terminal when you are in the same directory as the eqn.py file.
It prompts the user to enter a linear equation and prints out the answer right away!
The equation has to be linear and the variable is always x. (e.g 2/x=3) 

The repository name was a suggestion from a dumb friend.
